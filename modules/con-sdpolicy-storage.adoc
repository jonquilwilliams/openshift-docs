= Storage

== Encrypted-at-rest OS/Node storage
Master nodes use encrypted-at-rest-EBS storage.

== Encrypted-at-rest PV
EBS volumes used for persistent volumes are encrypted-at-rest by default.

== Block storage (RWO)
Persistent volumes are backed by block storage (AWS EBS), which is Read-Write-Once.

Persistent volumes can only be attached to a single node at a time and are specific to the availability zone in which they were provisioned, but they can be attached to any node in the availability zone.

The cloud provider has its own limits for how many PVs can be attached to a single node. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/volume_limits.html#instance-type-volume-limits[AWS instance type limits] for details.
