= Creating SharedVolume resources

You must create one SharedVolume resource per file system:access point pair in each project from which you want pods to access it.

.Procedure

. In the OpenShift web console, create and navigate to a project.
. Click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*. Find the entry for AWS EFS Operator and click *SharedVolume* under Provided APIs.
. Click *Create SharedVolume*.
. Edit the sample YAML:
.. Type a suitable value for `name`.
.. Replace the values of `accessPointID` and `fileSystemID` with the values from the EFS resources you created earlier.
. Click *Create*.
+
Creating a SharedVolume resource causes the AWS EFS Operator to generate and associate a PersistentVolume:PersistentVolumeClaim pair with the EFS access point you specified.
. Click *Storage* -> *Persistent Volume Claims* to verify that the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) exists and that it is bound. The PVC's name will be `pvc-<SharedVolume_name>`. The associated PV's name will be `pv-<project_name>-<SharedVolume_name>`.
