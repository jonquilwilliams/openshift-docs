= Uninstalling the EFS Operator

.Procedure

To remove the operator from your cluster:

. Delete all of the workloads using the PersistentVolumeClaims that were generated by the operator.
. Delete all of the SharedVolumes from all of the namespaces. The operator automatically removes the associated PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims.
. Uninstall the Operator:
.. Click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
.. Find the entry for AWS EFS Operator, and click the menu button on the right-hand side of the Operator.
.. Click *Uninstall* and confirm the deletion.

. Delete the SharedVolume CRD. This action triggers the deletion of the remaining operator-owned resources.
