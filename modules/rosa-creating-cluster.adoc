[NOTE]
====
Multiple availability zones (AZ) are recommended for production workloads. The default is a single availability zone. Use `--help` for an example of how to set this option manually or use interactive mode to be prompted for this setting.

To view other options when creating a cluster, enter `rosa create cluster --help`.

To follow a set of interactive prompts, enter `rosa create cluster --interactive`.

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Creating cluster with identifier '1de87g7c30g75qechgh7l5b2bha6r04e' and name 'rh-rosa-test-cluster1'
I: To view list of clusters and their status, run `rosa list clusters`
I: Cluster 'rh-rosa-test-cluster1' has been created.
I: Once the cluster is 'Ready' you will need to add an Identity Provider and define the list of cluster administrators. See `rosa create idp --help` and `rosa create user --help` for more information.
I: To determine when your cluster is Ready, run `rosa describe cluster rh-rosa-test-cluster1`.
