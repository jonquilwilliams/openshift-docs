= Role-based access overview

{project-title} (ROSA) uses role-based access control (RBAC) to determine whether a user is allowed to
perform a given action within a cluster.

[NOTE]
====
STS users use IAM roles.
====

Cluster roles are used to control access to the cluster. At this time, the use of roles and bindings are not used for project access in ROSA.

Note that authorization is a separate step from authentication, which is more about determining the identity of who is taking the action.

A cluster role binding is a binding that exists at the cluster level.

[id="default-roles_{context}"]
== Default cluster roles

{product-title} includes a set of default cluster roles that you can assign to specific clusters.

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===
|Default cluster role |Description

|`cluster-admin` |A super-administrator that can perform any action in any cluster.

|`dedicated-admin` |An administrator that can make most modifications in the cluster to which they are assigned.
|===

The cluster owner is a cluster-admin by default and cannot be revoked. Additional cluster-admins can be added to a cluster and those administrators can be revoked.

By default, you only get access to your cluster unless you are an organization administrator. An organization administrator has access to all of the clusters.

A common use case is to allow development teams to manage their own clusters but not other clusters. To do this, you can do one of the following actions:
* Create an organization for each team and grant `cluster-admin` roles to each of the users in that organization.
* Create shared AWS accounts instead of creating an organization.
