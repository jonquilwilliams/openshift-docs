= Setting up the `rosa` CLI

To set up the `rosa` CLI, download the latest release, then configure and initialize `rosa`:

.Procedure

. Download the latest release of `rosa` for your operating system from the link:https://github.com/openshift/rosa/releases/latest[`rosa` releases page on GitHub].
+
. (Optional) After downloading a release, you can rename the executable file you download to `rosa`, and then add `rosa` to your path.
+
. After downloading `rosa`, enable bash completion for `rosa`. Bash completion helps to automatically complete commands and suggest options when you press `Tab`. The command generates a bash completion file for `rosa` and sources it to your current shell session.
+
To configure your bash shell to load `rosa` completions for each session, add the following command to your `bashrc` file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`).
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ . <(rosa completion)
----
+
. Enter the following command to verify that your user now has `cluster-admin` access. A cluster administrator can run this command without errors, but a dedicated administrator cannot.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get all -n openshift-apiserver
